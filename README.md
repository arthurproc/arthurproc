### Hello World! 👋🏼

On my profile you will find a bunch of random stuff about things I learned and like to share, such as school projects and open source code I want to share with the community.

- 🎥 I do live streams on Twitch.tv with live coding, and everything that comes to my mind like games or even miniature painting.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning microservices and robust software archtecture design.
