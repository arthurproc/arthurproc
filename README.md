### Hello, World! 👋🏼

Welcome to my GitHub profile! Here, you'll discover a diverse collection of my learning experiences and interests that I'm eager to share. These include school projects and open-source code that I've made available to the community.

- 🎥 I host live streams on [Twitch.tv](https://www.twitch.tv/arthur_proc), where you can join me for live coding sessions, gaming, and even miniature painting adventures.
- 🌱 I’m currently diving into the world of microservices and focused on mastering robust software architecture design.
